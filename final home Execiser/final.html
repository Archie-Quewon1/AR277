                It’s almost like we need a strong dose of something to knock out all of the misinformation.
                But
                despite all the myths and urban legends, about half of the U.S. population is fully
                vaccinated.

                                Well, not to some. Vaccinated people are up against a
                                new set of myths — they’re literally magnetic or they’re
                                going to shed vaccine components and alter the DNA of
                                unvaccinated people. And despite the extra layer of
                                protection, they still have to grapple with the same
                                pandemic realities as everyone else.

                    So, what do vaccinated people need to do to stay safe? And is it still possible for them
                    to
                    spread
                    COVID-19 to others? Infectious disease specialist <span class=" co">Lyssette

                    questions and covers why vaccination is still one of our best weapons in the fight
                    against
                    COVID-

                <p>
                    isn’t the time to let your guard down. While the vaccines are potent, there’s still a
                    chance
                    that
                    you could become infected.</p><br>
